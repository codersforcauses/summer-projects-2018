### Background:

"P2S RUGBYWORKS is a collaborative, intensive and long-term skills development programme based on the Values of Rugby Union, with the aim of helping marginalised young people, currently outside of mainstream education back into sustainable education, employment and training.

P2S is working with young people to equip them with the necessary life skills to PREPARE them to seize OPPORTUNITY

Additionally, P2S is working with the community to create OPPORTUNITY for young people to enter sustainable Education, Training and Employment

Equipping them with the necessary life skills and reduce the negative perception held of them." _(Taken from http://www.p2srugbyworks.com/about-us/what-is-p2s-rugbyworks/. More details can be found using this link.)_

Currently, the coaches input data of each student into a word document and then accumulate that data onto a common spreadsheet for others to review.

### Description:

P2S RugbyWorks requires a way to to easily have their coaches input data about their players, allowing them to keep track on their progress in multiple fields.

* Autonomy
    * How do they cope with change?
    * How was the student in school/session?
    * How confident was the student?
* Attitude
    * How did they approach tasks and activities?
* Communication
* Reliability

Admins should be able to access and output easy to visualise reports for each student, and overall reports for the entire demographic.

This project may have to be integrated into an existing domain, but should be isolated to its own system and server. The data must also be retained for at least 2 years for each student to graphically display progress over the duration.

### Skills:

P2S RugbyWorks will be a progressive webapp that takes advantage of industry standard frontend and backend systems.

    Knowledge of these systems is not required to join this project, but any experience in web development will useful. All skills will be taught while doing the project, so don't worry if you think you are not capable yet ðŸ˜€.

The website will use a `NodeJS` backend with possible integration with frameworks like `ExpressJS` or `FeathersJS (A wrapper for ExpressJS)`. The database will be developed and tested with `MongoDB` and `Mongoose`, and then shifted to a `SQL` based system in deployment (if needed). Frontend systems will be created with a framework called `VueJS`. This will be quite easy to learn if you have experience in `JavaScript`, or have used any other front-end frameworks before. Along with these frameworks, it is essential that you also know how to use `git (either the CLI or by using GitHub Desktop)`.

>The paragraph above is only a guideline if the group seeks guidance from the CFC Committee. However, members are free to choose frameworks that are convenient for them (This will be subjected to a majority vote in the group).

### Note:
P2S RugbyWorks will be having a session with the members working on this project and the coaches mid-December (most likeley be on Wednesday 12th). Please make sure you have the time to make it to this session as it will be fundamental to the progress of the project.
