### Background:

Teach For Australia is a not-for-profit organisation that helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds with basic educational skills. While helping students at partnered schools, Teach For Australia's associates (volunteers) earn a teaching degree during the two years they volunteer to teach. Candidates who wish to volunteer must fit certain criteria before they can teach a field.

### Description:

Teach for Australia is currently having to read through a candidate's transcript manually to figure out which field the candidate is eligible to teach. For example, to be able to teach chemistry you need to have completed at least two level 1 science units and at least 1 chemistry unit. The project outcome is a site that allow students to enter their unit code and categories that the unit go under and gives them which area they might be able to teach.

### Skills:

The project will be a Website (preferably one hosted on GitHub pages to keep costs to minimum or attached to the current Teach For Australia website).  Apart from this, members would also need to know how to use source control effectively (either through the CLI or GitHub Desktop).

The group will need to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and database system (SQL or NoSQL based). SQL is preferable as they currently use a MySQL server.

    The required skills with be taught to you over the course of the project if you do not have experience with the required languages.
